# Data Visualization with Matplotlib

Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization for a pharmaceutical testing laboratory.

## Description

This repository is designed to analyze laboratory test results from a study aimed at developing treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 



The dashboard includes a drop-down menu that displays the numerical code for each individual sample. When a sample is selected, the “Demographic Info” panel is populated with metadata and the following three charts are populated with data:
* Bar graph displaying the top 10 OTUs by count
* Gauge plot showing the belly button scrubs per week
* Bubble plot displaying OTU counts for the entire sample
